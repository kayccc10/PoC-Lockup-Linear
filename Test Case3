Proof of Concept for Gas Limit Exceeded
Overview:
Demonstrates high gas consumption in the _calculateStreamedAmount function of the SablierV2LockupLinear contract.

Actors:
Attacker: User triggering high gas transaction.
Victim: SablierV2LockupLinear contract.
Protocol: Sablier streaming protocol.

Working Test Case:
// Solidity code demonstrating high gas usage

contract GasUsageTest {
    SablierV2LockupLinear public lockupContract;
    
    constructor(address lockupAddress) {
        lockupContract = SablierV2LockupLinear(lockupAddress);
    }
    
    // Function to demonstrate high gas usage
    function highGasUsage(uint256 streamId) public {
        uint128 amountStreamed = lockupContract._calculateStreamedAmount(streamId);
        // This line consumes high gas due to complex calculations
    }
}

Steps:
Deploy SablierV2LockupLinear: Deploy the contract and initialize necessary parameters.
Initiate High Gas Call: Call the highGasUsage function with a valid stream ID.
Observe Gas Usage: Monitor the gas consumption during the execution to verify high usage.
